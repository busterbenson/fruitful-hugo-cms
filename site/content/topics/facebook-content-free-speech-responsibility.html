<div class="row pl-3">
	<div class="col-6">
		<h3 class="mt-4">A1: Employees should be held responsible for the actions of their employer, and should not to be a shill for them.</h3>
		<div class="strong">Strongest case supporting this:</div>
		<ul>
			<li>When your company is being criticized for potentially hurting people, communities, and elections, celebrating your company without acknowledging this other reality is irresponsible.</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="strong">Qualifications and concessions:</div>

			<li>This is not a criticism of how hard you worked, or how good you are at your job.</li>

		<ol>
			<li>"To the designers who worked on this: PLEASE spare us all the ‚Äúso thrilled to announce this is the project I‚Äôve been working on for the last year so proud of the team they put in so much hard work and dedication now off to the next thing we can fuckall with!‚Äù" - <a href="https://twitter.com/lindadong/status/1187749608216248320">@lindadong</a></li>
			<li>"And there we have it. Why can‚Äôt I just let these people with $250k+ salaries enjoy their money in peace, no matter if what they make hurts people, communities, elections. I‚Äôm heartless ya‚Äôll" - <a href="https://twitt.er.com/lindadong/status/1187782914408247296">Linda Dong</a></li>
			<li>"I‚Äôm not saying that your team didn‚Äôt work hard, I‚Äôm sure everyone worked very hard - it‚Äôs a talented group." - <a href="https://twitter.com/lindadong/status/1187891213849874434">@lindadong</a></li>
			<li>"People are upset because Facebook could choose to optimize social good over profits, but chooses not to do so." - <a href="https://twitter.com/chabotc/status/1188193735248666624">@chabotc</a></li>

	<div class="col-6">
		<h3 class="mt-4">A2: Employees should be allowed to be proud of their work, even if they don't condone all the actions of their employer.</h3>
		<div class="strong">Strongest case supporting this:</div>
		<ul>
			<li>You don't know the whole story. There's more to it than gets covered in the news. The issue is more complicated when viewed from the inside, and there are people who care deeply about the issues and work hard at fixing them, though their work may not be visible to the outside.</li>
			<li>It's easy to say that one should leave a job at a company that has been criticized by the public when it's not you, or when you are wealthy and privileged. Taking this stance could hurt less privileged people.</li>

		<div class="strong">Quotes from supporters:</div>
		<ul>
			<li>"Thats easy to say when you're sitting in the stands and didn't actually do any of the work. I happen to know the designers who worked on this and I know they care deeply about journalism. They are proud of their work, as they should be. Period." - <a href="https://twitter.com/karlamickens/status/1187763337586794497">Karla Cole</a></li>
			<li>"So let them collect their coin, support their families and be happy. And if they want to talk about their work, they can! You don‚Äôt get to decide that ish." - <a href="https://twitter.com/karlamickens/status/1187777661294338049">Karla Cole</a></li>
			<li>"Yeah, people worked hard on this. They continue to. I'm proud of them, but there's a ton left to do." - <a href="https://twitter.com/jtroll/status/1187875411121717249">@jtroll</a></li>

<div class="row pl-3">
	<div class="col-6">
		<h3 class="mt-4">A1: Yes. They had a big role in spreading misinformation and continued efforts to relax content moderation policies show that things have not improved.</h3>
		<div class="strong">Strongest case supporting this:</div>
		<ul>
			<li>The company is doing shameful things that ended up hurting people and affecting an election, and they don't seem to be taking many measures to change that.</li>

		<ol>
			<li>"I think that given FB‚Äôs critical role in the spread of misinformation during the 2016 elections, its relaxation of policies banning false claims in political ads, Mark‚Äôs evasion of responsibility in congressional testimonial, etc the release of this news product is shameful" - <a href="https://twitter.com/lindadong/status/1187891585763069952">@lindadong</a></li>

	<div class="col-6">
		<h3 class="mt-4 pl-3">A2: No. While they may have influenced the election, they are not doing so maliciously. They are in uncharted waters, and doing their best to learn to navigate these new problems.</h3>
		<div class="strong">Strongest case supporting this:</div>
		<em></em>
		<ul>
			<li>Though there is a lot of criticism of Facebook's behavior, they didn't do anything wrong.</li>
			<li>What is being mistaken for wrong decisions is instead hard decisions about how to enforce the First Amendment right of freedome of speech as authentically as possible.</li>

			<li>"I understand how the media made FB look like baddies, but based on all the information I have, FB didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. There were many really hard decisions (eg choice: either we appear to support white supremacy, or we appear to limit free speech.)" - <a href="https://twitter.com/rsms/status/1187943051840278529">@rsms</a>
				<ul>
					<li>"Strongly disagree. Facebook is not society. The analogy here is that Breitbart would exist with/without Facebook, yes. But when Facebook actively promote them as a legitimate source, it‚Äôs not ‚Äújust holding up a mirror to society‚Äù ‚Äî  it‚Äôs taking an active role in defining it." - <a href="https://twitter.com/krjepsen/status/1188216764653559809">@krjespen</a></li>
