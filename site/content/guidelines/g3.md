# **G3: Ask open questions.**
{{< /hint >}}

### 1. Great questions create room for great answers. Don’t ask questions that you think you already know the answer to — ask open-ended questions and aim to be surprised.
### 2. Make an honest effort to find an existing answer before asking someone to dig it up for you.
### 3. Only ask questions that can be addressed by people in the conversation, and ask them as individuals rather than as representatives of a broader group.
### 4. Listen generously and charitably.
