# **G4: Speak for yourself.**
{{< /hint >}}

### 1. Speak only for yourself and your own experiences. Don’t try to interpret other people’s experiences, let them do that for you.
### 2. When answering questions, make sure the question is addressed to you. If it’s not meant for you, ask if they’d like to hear your perspective, or don’t answer it.
### 3. Don’t speculate how other people or groups are thinking, or why they did something. Invite them to speak for themselves.
