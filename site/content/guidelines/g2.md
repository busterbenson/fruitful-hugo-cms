# **G2: Understand first.**
{{< /hint >}}

### 1. Consider the possibility of unfamiliar and scary ideas. Ideas can’t bite.
### 2. Seek to understand alternative viewpoints before stating your own.
### 3. Don’t jump to conclusions about what others think without confirmation. Leave some room that you might be missing something, then ask them to help you bridge that gap.
### 4. Accept strong emotions as they are expressed. Don’t interpret them as attacks, but rather invitations to inquire further about something clearly important.
### 5. If things are getting heated, ask for clarification as a way to stall while you have a chance to lower your blood pressure a bit.
