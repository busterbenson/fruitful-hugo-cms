# **G5: Help each other.**
{{< /hint >}}

### 1. Challenge yourself and others to think, feel, and be better versions of ourselves as individuals and as a community.
### 2. Suggest improvements where you see things not working. Even better, volunteer to fix them!
### 3. Admit your own mistakes if it’s relevant to the conversation, even if nobody else would’ve noticed.
### 4. Ask for kind and direct feedback. Before delivering kind and direct feedback make sure the person wants it and ask them how they’d like to receive it.
