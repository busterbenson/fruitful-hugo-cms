# **G1: Use friendly language.**
{{< /hint >}}

### 1. Always use respectful language, even when talking about people or groups that aren’t present.
### 2. Don’t posture or post opinions as facts. Make your case and invite people to disagree.
### 3. Use language (and silence) that invites dialogue so that quieter people can enter the conversation.
### 4. Be willing to be wrong. Be excited even! It means you’ll be more right going forward.
### 5. If someone has broadened your perspective on a topic, even a little bit, let them know. This is a win-win for everyone.
### 6. Don’t pile on against someone. If you see that happening, help restore a friendly dynamic even if you disagree with them.
